# Malware Analysis and CyberSecurity Portfolio

Hey there! I'm **Aqil Najmi**, and I'm just a high school student who's really into cybersecurity. I'm currently doing the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** and looking out for other certs too. I made this repo to share how I learn to spot and analyze malware.

This is part of my journey to hopefully work in cybersecurity one day. I'm not an expert yet, but I'm learning new stuff everyday!

## Tools I’ve Used While Learning

- **Hybrid Analysis** – I use this to check how malware acts inside a sandbox.
- **MalwareBazaar** – It's where I get sample malware to play around with.
- **NeikidEv** – Helped me learn static and dynamic analysis stuff.
- **VirusTotal & VT Graph** – For quick checks and to see how samples are linked.
- **dnSpy** – I use this to look into .NET malware and check the code inside.
- **JetBrains IDE** – Makes it easier to edit and reverse some stuff.
- **YARA Rules** – Trying to learn how to detect malware based on patterns.

## What’s Inside This Repo

- Some malware reports I wrote
- Notes when I reverse engineer stuff
- Hash checks and what I found
- Behavior patterns I noticed
- A few YARA rules

This is all for **learning only**, not for any bad stuff.

## Connect

If you're also into this kinda thing, or want to collab or just talk about malware, cybersecurity or even wanting to give me advice, feel free to reach out. I’m still learning and open to feedback or help too.

**Note:** Everything here is for educational use only. Please be careful and use safe environments when working with malware. I only do this in VMs or sandbox.
